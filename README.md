What is a fixture?
A fixture is a collection of files that contain the serialized contents of the database. Each fixture has a unique name, and the files that comprise the fixture can be distributed over multiple directories, in multiple applications.

How to produce a fixture?
Fixtures can be generated by manage.py dumpdata. Itâ€™s also possible to generate custom fixtures by directly using serialization tools or even by handwriting them.

How to use a fixture?
Fixtures can be used to pre-populate database with data for tests.
